	•	500+ active users within one month of launch.
	•	Daily active engagement rate of at least 30%.

Next Steps

	•	Technical setup, including API integration and frontend development.
	•	Set up Supabase database integration and security.
	•	Begin manual testing and iterative refinement based on initial feedback.
