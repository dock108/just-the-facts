## Just the Facts Deployment & CI/CD Plan

### Deployment Strategy Overview
Just the Facts will utilize a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline specifically optimized for streamlined web application deployments.

### CI/CD Pipeline Setup

#### Version Control
- **Platform:** GitHub
- **Branching Strategy:** Git Flow

#### Continuous Integration
- Automated build processes triggered by commits and pull requests to `develop` and `main` branches.
- Automatic execution of code linting, static analysis, and unit tests on each commit.

#### Continuous Deployment
- Automated web deployments upon merging to the `main` branch, subject to passing tests and review approvals.

### Deployment Steps & Checklist

#### Web Deployment
- Compile and build React.js application.
- Deploy application to hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS Amplify).
- Verify HTTPS and SSL certifications.
- Execute immediate post-deployment health checks and smoke tests.

### Rollback Strategy
- Rapid rollback to previous stable version through deployment platform configurations in case of deployment issues.

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Real-time monitoring of application uptime, responsiveness, and error rates.
- Utilize tools such as Sentry, Firebase Analytics, or Google Analytics to gain actionable operational insights.

### Production Readiness Criteria
- Successful passing of all automated test suites.
- Completion of performance and security reviews without significant issues.
- Fully updated and approved comprehensive documentation.
- Stakeholder notifications and explicit deployment approvals.

### Tools & Platforms
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Hosting Providers:** AWS, Vercel, Netlify
- **Monitoring & Analytics:** Firebase Analytics, Sentry, Google Analytics

### Post-Deployment Validation
- Conduct immediate production smoke tests following deployment.
- Continuously monitor application usage and promptly respond to user feedback or reported issues.

### Continuous Improvement
- Regular evaluation and enhancement of CI/CD pipeline efficiency and effectiveness.
- Continuous iteration informed by deployment performance, user feedback, and technological developments.
