### Prompt for Expert AI Engineer: Building Just the Facts Web App

**Task Overview:**  
Develop a new application called **Just the Facts** from scratch. While the existing ToneSmith folder is provided for reference only, treat it strictly as a guide and build the Just the Facts application independently from the root level. Just the Facts is an AI-powered web application designed to deliver concise, unbiased summaries based solely on factual accuracy.

**Application Description:**  
- **Input:** Users enter a topic or event.
- **Output:** A concise, fact-based summary emphasizing objectivity, clarity, and clearly cited sources.
- **User Interface:** Implement a clean, intuitive single-screen design optimized specifically for the app's functionality.

**Steps to Complete:**

**Phase 1: Documentation Creation**
1. **Requirements & Specifications:**
   - Define clear functional and non-functional requirements tailored specifically to Just the Facts.
   - Establish user stories and detailed acceptance criteria.

2. **UI/UX Design:**
   - Create fresh wireframes and mockups reflecting Just the Facts' unique functionality.
   - Develop a dedicated UI style guide, including colors, typography, and icons that distinctly represent Just the Facts.

3. **AI & Prompt Engineering:**
   - Craft precise prompts for factual summarization that prioritize clarity, neutrality, and verifiable source citation.

4. **Testing & QA Strategy:**
   - Design testing scenarios specific to factual summarization outputs and user interactions.

5. **Deployment & CI/CD Plan:**
   - Outline detailed deployment procedures unique to Just the Facts.

6. **Operational Guidelines:**
   - Specify error handling, logging, and monitoring processes suited to the factual summarization workflow.

7. **Legal & Compliance:**
   - Develop comprehensive privacy policies and terms of service appropriate for Just the Facts.

8. **Cursor MDC Usage Guide:**
   - Establish MDC documentation practices specifically relevant to Just the Facts.

**Phase 2 (Pending Review & Approval): Code Development**
- Upon approval of all documentation, independently code Just the Facts starting from the project root, referencing the ToneSmith folder strictly for conceptual understanding and guidance only.

**Deliverables:**
- Complete and approved Just the Facts documentation.
- Fully developed, maintainable Just the Facts codebase.

Please ensure all documentation is finalized and approved prior to beginning the coding phase.
