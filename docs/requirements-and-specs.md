## Just the Facts MVP Requirements & Specifications

### Functional Requirements

**User Stories:**

1. **As a user**, I want to input a topic or event to quickly obtain an objective, fact-based summary.

2. **As a user**, I want a simple and clear interface to enter topics without distractions.

3. **As a user**, I want to click a straightforward "Summarize" button that initiates a concise and factual summary of my requested topic.

4. **As a user**, I want the generated summary to be based on information retrieved from real-time web searches, with facts clearly linked to their sources via inline markers (e.g., [1], [2]) corresponding to a list of source URLs and titles displayed below the summary.

5. **As a user**, I want an easy option to copy and share the summarized content with others for convenience and efficiency.

6. **As a user**, I expect the summary provided to be unbiased, clear, and concise without opinions or subjective interpretation, derived *only* from the retrieved web search results.

7. **As a system**, I must perform a real-time web search based on the user's topic to gather current information and credible sources before generating any summary.

  - Transparent privacy policy and data usage clearly accessible within the app.

- **Compatibility:**
  - Optimized to function consistently across major web browsers and devices.
