## Just the Facts Operational Guidelines

### Error Handling & Logging Standards

#### Logging Practices
- **Structured Logging:** Implement structured logging for frontend and backend components.
- **Log Levels:** Clearly categorize logs:
  - `ERROR`: Critical issues causing system failures.
  - `WARN`: Potential issues requiring attention.
  - `INFO`: Routine operational information.
  - `DEBUG`: Detailed diagnostic data for development and troubleshooting.

#### Error Management
- Uniform error handling mechanism with clearly defined codes and messages.
- Ensure sensitive data is not exposed through logs or error outputs.

### Monitoring and Alerting

#### Application Health
- Perform regular uptime and endpoint availability checks.
- Implement real-time alerts for service interruptions or performance degradation.

#### User Experience Monitoring
- Monitor response times and backend API latency.
- Track frequency of application errors and crashes via tools like Sentry.

#### Alerting System
- Set up alerts for critical errors, performance issues, and unusual traffic patterns.
- Define escalation paths clearly, specifying responsibilities for incident responses.

### Maintenance Procedures

#### Regular Updates
- Monthly dependency reviews and updates.
- Prompt implementation of security patches upon discovery.

#### Codebase Management
- Conduct routine code reviews and regular refactoring.
- Maintain updated documentation reflecting system changes.

### Incident Response Plan

#### Incident Detection & Response
- Clearly define procedures for incident detection, categorization, and response.
- Establish rapid communication channels for incident escalation.

#### Post-Incident Review
- Perform comprehensive root-cause analyses following critical incidents.
- Document learnings and proactively implement enhancements to prevent recurrence.

### Analytics & Reporting

#### User Behavior & Engagement
- Continuously monitor user engagement and feature usage.
- Leverage analytics to inform feature development and user experience optimization.

#### Operational Reporting
- Generate regular reports on performance, error rates, and system uptime.
- Proactively utilize reporting insights to identify areas for improvement.

### Continuous Improvement
- Schedule regular operational reviews to assess system health and guideline effectiveness.
- Implement proactive adjustments based on operational feedback and analytics insights.
